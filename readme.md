# Here's a thing
HTML5 canvas is cool, and here's a thing I made with it.

Two inter-galactic Squarezoids in an epic battle across the universe, fall prety to an event-horizon and endlessly spin in the rim of a black hole, doomed to never leave. Or, just two glowing squares that are circling around a circle-path. Choose your own adventure!

It's just a thing.
